Preparing your code
There are 3 variables that you need to change. Add your SSID and password so that your ESP is able to establish a communication with your router:

// Replace with your SSID and Password
const char* ssid = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_SSID";
const char* password = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_PASSWORD";

Enter your Thing Speak Write API key in this variable:

// Replace with your unique Thing Speak WRITE API KEY
const char* apiKey = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_ThingSpeak_WRITE_API_KEY";
